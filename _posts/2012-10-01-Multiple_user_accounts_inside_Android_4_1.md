After rooting Android Jelly Bean device you will gain access to a hidden OS functionality: user profiles.
It's hidden because it's unfinished. Some apps may not work, like Google Chrome for instance. It's always crashing,
while running by a secondary user. You cannot hide apps for a guest account etc. Visually you cannot determine what user is currently active,
notifications and recent apps do not clear while switching between users.
Jelly Beanâ€™s user profiles are far away from perfect, but still they are useful.

To manage user accounts you will need

First of all, switch to the root account using the <code>su</code> command.
You can check your user and group typing: <code>id</code>.

</p>
Now you can create a new user:
<pre>
<code>
    pm create-user USER_NAME
</code>
</pre>
Apps and some system settings are in /data/user/USER_ID.
The new profile is limited compared to the original. Limitations can be seen in the settings menu.

You can switch between users via the command line:
<pre>
<code>
    am switch-user USER_ID
</code>
</pre>

As you can see, you have to type the user id. You can also switch using graphic interface. Just press and hold the Power button.

</p>

To get the list of all users on a current device, type:
<pre>
<code>
    pm list-users
</code>
</pre>

To delete a user pass the user id to the <code>pm remove-user</code> command.
<pre>
<code>
    pm remove-user USER_ID
</code>
</pre>
